# Tracking Server

## Writing A Client
Check the `api/` directory, and send a JSON request to the correct API endpoints, as noted in main.go. Or just ask Will for details

## How to run
You can run it locally by just running `go run .`. You can launch a new fly app by running `fly launch -o sdev-school-project --name <server_app_name>`. Follow the prompts, the defaults are probably fine.
